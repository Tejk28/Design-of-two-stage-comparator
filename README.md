# Design-of-two-stage-comparator
Design and implementation of two stage slewing comparator according to given specifications in Cadence
Specifications: tp= 100 ns; VOH = 2 V;  VOL = -2 V
                        VDD = 2.5 V;  VSS = -2.5 V
                        C2 = 5 pF; C1 = 0.2 pF
                        Vin(min) = 4 mV 
                         ICMR = -0.5 V to 2 V

The file contents the calculation for the design and results of the design.
